## Introduction

About Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR, one can look at wiki for [detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI), and the evolution  of .NET framework progress is written in [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework).

### Architecture

Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR often plays an important role in interop native C/C++ between C#. The architecture is shown bellow.

Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR can access C#, C++/C dll, they can even use some C++/C code and Win32 API directly. The following things is what Cpp/CLI can do.

* Use functions in C# .NET framework:
    * If you lack of Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR example code, you can translate C# code to Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR code.
* Use function in C++/C:
    * Not all the code in C++ can be used such as [std::thread](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread), [std::mutex](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex). If you really want to use C++ function similar to std::thread / std::mutex, you can:
        * Compile [boost C++](http://www.boost.org/) by yourself so that you can use in Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR.
        * Use [System::Threading](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/library/system.threading(v=vs.110).aspx) namespace, and use the function in it.
        * Wrap C++/C code as dll, then wrap it in Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR, so that you can use it.
*  Use custom GUI components developed in C# or [WPF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130(v=vs.110).aspx) GUI components:
    * First, build dll project which include custom GUI components you want.
    * Second, take reference of the dll you built in C#/WPF project.
* Wrap native functions from C++/C or dll as .NET framework dll which can be referenced by C# or other .NET framework language. The famous example of this usage is [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org/), the DirectX wrapper, which use DirectX dll from client OS.

### Drawback

The drawback of .NET framework is that its application can be easily decompile by [ILSpy](http://ilspy.net/). The follwing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4bBadA6O-Y) shows that C# application can be decompiled completely in ILSpy. To solve it, we can use obfuscator software such as [ConfuserEx](https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/). Cpp/CLI or Cpp/CLR can also be decompiled, but reveal as [IL language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) which is hard to understand compare to C# decompiled code. Therefore, if you want to protect your code, you can:

#### Suggestion1
* Wrap important code as dll
* Use dll:
   * in C#, and use obfuscator.
   * in C++/CLI or C++/CLR.
   
#### Suggestion2
* Wrap important code as dll
* Wrap dll as .NET dll by using C++/CLI or C++/CLR
* Use .NET dll in C#, and use obfuscator.
