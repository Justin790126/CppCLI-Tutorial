# Custom event

In previous tutorial, we have learn how to add event by toolbox or by code. Now, it's time to learn how to define your own event to evoke, and run the certain callback function. The event will play an important role in interacting between windows forms and components. More detail can be found in [delegate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/c320cx3h.aspx) and [event](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/58cwt3zh.aspx)

## Situation
If user click button in **SubForm**, and the label in **MyForm** want to show some message. 

## Create a button in SubForm
Like previous less, we create button with bellow properties.

## Create a label in MyForm
Create label for showing message.

## Define delegate and event

Open **SubForm.h**, we will define a custom event when **SubForm** is constructed.

* Define delegate
System::String^ msg is the event arg which will be send from **SubForm**
````
delegate void Del_BtnClicked(System::String^ msg);
````

* Define event
````
event Del_BtnClicked^ BtnClicked;
````

* The final result should be:

````
#pragma once

namespace Project1 {
    ......
    delegate void Del_BtnClicked(System::String^ msg);

    ......
	public ref class SubForm : public System::Windows::Forms::Form
	{
	public:
        event Del_BtnClicked^ BtnClicked;
    ......
````

* Implement event in **SubForm.h**

Since we want to know when the button in SubForm is clicked. Therefore, we add click event on button in SubForm.h with **property dialog**.

````
    ......
    
    private: System::Void btnCallBack_Click(System::Object^  sender, System::EventArgs^  e) {

    }
    
    ......
````

Now, feedback some message when button on click

````
    ......
    private: System::Void btnCallBack_Click(System::Object^  sender, System::EventArgs^  e) {
        BtnClicked("Button in subform had clicked");
    }
    ......
````


## Define handler in MyForm

Now, we want to know whether the SubForm had finished construct for not. We should add event handler function in **MyForm.cpp** according to [previouse lesson](/doc/Ch5/5-3.md).

````
#include "MyForm.h"

namespace Project1 {

    MyForm::MyForm(void)
    {
        ......
        SubForm^ form = gcnew SubForm();
        form->BtnClicked += gcnew Project1::Del_BtnClicked(this, &Project1::MyForm::OnBtnClicked);
        form->Show();
        /*MessageBox::Show(form->SecreteString);

        form->SecreteString = "New secrete string is shown";
        MessageBox::Show(form->SecreteString);*/
    }
    
    ......

````
In **OnBtnClicked** function, we use MessageBox to show the event arg sent by SubForm button, and change the **Text** property in **MyForm**.
````
......  
void Project1::MyForm::OnBtnClicked(System::String ^msg)
{
    this->lblShowCallBack->Text = msg;
    MessageBox::Show(msg);
}
......
````
    
Now, build and run, you will see the result.

* Before click on button in **subForm**

* After click on button in **subForm** 

![After](/doc/Ch6/img/6-3-4.jpg)
