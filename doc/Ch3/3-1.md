## Introduction

Look at part of **main.cpp** bellowed from [last lesson](/doc/Ch2/2-2.md). In this line we create an object with **gcnew**
    
* C++/CLR(C++/CLI):
    
        Project1::MyForm^ form = gcnew Project1::MyForm();
        
Compared to traditional C++ pointer noation bellow

*  Traditional C++:
  
       char* test = new char[10];

Those who use C++ should delete the **test** varaible to prevent memory leak.
    
However, in  C++/CLR(C++/CLI)
* **Pointer**  is **^** notation
* **new** notation is **gcnew** which means the object will do garbage collect automatically.

If we want to get the address of variable.

*  Traditional C++:
We use **&** notation to get the address of some_variable
    
        int test = &some_variable

* In  C++/CLR(C++/CLI):
We use **%** notation to get the address of GUI

        Project1::MyForm form;
        Application::Run(%form);
