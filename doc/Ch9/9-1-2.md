## System::Threading

### Thread

Sometimes, when we consider performance, we'll open another thread to do something. In this example we use [System::Threading::Thread](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/library/xx3ezzs2(v=vs.110).aspx) to create a thread, and use [ParameterizedThreadStart](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/library/system.threading.parameterizedthreadstart(v=vs.110).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&cs-lang=cpp#code-snippet-2) to pass arguments to the thread we created.

In  Receiver.h:
````
ref class Receiver {

    public:

        void Record_mention_box(Object^ file_name);

        void call();
        
    private:
        Receiver^ receiverInstance = Receiver::GetInstance();
}
````
 

In  Receiver.cpp:

ParameterizedThreadStart take an object instance of **receiverInstance** and its **Receiver::Record_mention_box** function as arguments. When we start the thread, we feed **"test string"** as an argument to the thread we created.
````
void Receiver::Record_mention_box(System::String test)
{
    Console::WriteLine("test thread with argvs = {0}", test); // Print "test thread with argvs = test string"
}

void Receiver::call() {
    Thread^ msgbox_th = gcnew Thread(gcnew::Threading::ParameterizedThreadStart(receiverInstance, &Receiver::Record_mention_box));
    msgbox_th->Start(gcnew System::String("test string"));
}
````

### Mutex

When we want to do something which will interupt by other thread in main thread, we need to protect the data we modified currently. Therefore, we'll use [Mutex](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/library/system.threading.mutex(v=vs.110).aspx) to lock the code section in Cpp/CLR(Cpp/CLI)

#### Usage
Here we will lock the code section before we do something.
````
    System::Threading::Mutex^ mtx = gcnew System::Threading::Mutex();
    mtx->WaitOne();
    
    Do somethin......
    
    mtx->ReleaseMutex();
````

### Monitor

The goal of [Monitor](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/library/system.threading.monitor(v=vs.110).aspx) is the same as *Mutex*, to lock some code section to protect the data modified in main thread.  

#### Usage
````
     Queue<System::String^>^ m_inputQueue;
    Monitor::Enter(m_inputQueue);
    try {
        System::String^ ele1 = "element1";
        m_inputQueue->Enqueue(ele1);
    } finally {
        Monitor::Exit(m_inputQueue);
    }
````
