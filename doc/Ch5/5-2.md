# Property

Inherit from [previous project](/doc/Ch5/src/5-1). We'll now learn how to edit property in visual studio by property dialog or by code.

* Open **MyForm.h** in visual studio

![MyForm](/doc/Ch5/img/5-2-1.jpg)

* Select the **label** we created.

![SelectLabel](/doc/Ch5/img/5-2-2.jpg)

* Right click on **Properties**

![Properties](/doc/Ch5/img/5-2-3.jpg)

* You'll see all propoerties here

![PropDialog](/doc/Ch5/img/5-2-4.jpg)

Now, we'll name our component with [.NET framework component style](/doc/CppCLIstyleGuide.md).

* In this lesson, we name our label as **lblName**

![lblName](/doc/Ch5/img/5-2-5.jpg)

* Now, look at **MyForm.h**, the name we typed was written in **InitializeComponent** automatically.

        ......
		void InitializeComponent(void)
		{
            ......
            this->lblName->Name = L"lblName";
        ......


* If we want to edit the property by code, we can also write in .cpp file. Take **MyForm.cpp** as example, I want to edit the [**Text**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/library/0cs4xb3d(v=vs.110).aspx) property in label.

    Open **MyForm.cpp**, add line after **InitializeComponent** was called.

        ......
        MyForm::MyForm(void)
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            //
            //TODO: Add the constructor code here
            //
            Logger^ logger = gcnew Logger();
    
            System::String^ msg = System::String::Format("My name is {0}, My wife name is {1}", "Justin", "Anna");
           logger->Log(msg);
            logger->Debug(msg);
    
            this->lblName->Text = "Justin chang";
        }
        ......
        
* Now, run the code in visual studio by pressing F5
